I am trying to debug why my IOT devices don't always recover from a DNS/DHCP failure &ndash; it is quite hard as they simply get stuck, not doing anything until rebooted.   
I'll go over what I am currently doing to try and shed some light on the possible causes.

# Preparing for disaster

Only one of the devices I have currently installed is accessible from the serial debug port &ndash; the rest are carefully hidden inside walls, and while I was confident that
my changes to the firmware would work (as they work on a 'blank' device) I wanted to be doubly sure and avoid the pain of re-wiring everything.

The most accessible ESP8266 is connected to my Odroid N2 via USB, but this Odroid is running CoreElec, a very stripped down linux distribution for media which has no package manager.


Usually the tool I choose for serial debugging is `minicom` so I set on to cross-compile it from my x86\_64 box so that it'd run on the aarch64 Odroid.

## Compiling minicom


```bash
minicom $ ./configure --host=aarch64 --build=x86_64 CC='arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-8'
minicom $ make -j8
ld: minicom/src/window.c:196: undefined reference to `tputs'
ld: minicom/src/window.c:1954: undefined reference to `tgetstr'
ld: minicom/src/window.c:1967: undefined reference to `tgetnum'
```

The complaints about `tputs` point to missing `ncurses` references, so off to build ncurses.

```bash
ncurses $ ./configure --host=aarch64 --build=x86_64 CC='arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-8'
ncurses $ make -j8
```

Linking the newly-built ncurses

```bash
minicom $ ./configure --host=aarch64 --build=x86_64 CC='arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-8 -L~/git/ncurses/lib'
minicom $ make -j8
minicom $ file src/minicom
src/minicom: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3, BuildID[sha1]=4a85f2b5e2e7d0a48214743265505cc23b461a7e, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped
```

Copy the binary over aaand:

```bash
root@odroid $  ./minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
No termcap database present!
```

Checking `/etc/terminfo/README` in my debian machine has all the info I need

```
This directory is for system-local terminfo descriptions. By default,
ncurses will search ${HOME}/.terminfo first, then /etc/terminfo (this
directory), then /lib/terminfo, and last not least /usr/share/terminfo.
```

so let's retry after copying over `/usr/share/terminfo` to `~/.terminfo`

```bash
root@odroid $ ./minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
No termcap entry for xterm
```

Let's just override that with something present in `~/.terminfo`:
```bash
root@odroid $ ./minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -t rxvt-256color
Welcome to minicom 2.6.2

# Logging

By the very nature of these devices, it is hard to get information out of them. They have no screens, and although they do have a single LED on which they could show
some pattern, they are usually *inside* the walls.  

Adding to these charateristics, there's hardly any guarantee on **when** we'll see a failure &ndash; and given there's no local storage, the best that can be done is to *try* and output something useful on the network.  

I implemented this with a very basic UDP server and a pipe-delimited message format `NAME|CONTENTS`.  
After updating the `common.py` and making some small tweaks to the firmware on all devices, the data received on the logging server looks something like:

During normal operation:  

```bash
$ ./logserver.py
