<div class="warning">
I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing when it comes to C++, CMake or Android, so it's likely that my struggles are user error.
</div>


Some time ago, Firefox [introduced](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/118.0/releasenotes/) in-browser, on-device translation for webpages. I know that Chrome users have had this forever,
but I'm not comfortable sending all my browsing data to Google.

This new feature was super useful for me, and I started wondering if I could also use it outside of the browser.


I did some research and found out that Mozilla publishes the [firefox-translation-models on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-translations-models/tree/main), and that
there's a piece of software called [bergamot-translator](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator) which can run these models, by wrapping [marian-nmt](https://marian-nmt.github.io).


With some basic idea of the software landscape, I tried it out

## Running bergamot-translator on Linux

`bergamot-translator` is very straight-forward to build

```bash
$ git clone
$ mkdir build
$ sudo apt install libpcre2-dev libopenblas-dev
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
```

but how to _run_ this? I read a bunch of code for CI/tests/.. and figured out that I needed a YAML file exactly like this one:

```yaml
bergamot-mode: native
models:
  - firefox-translations-models/models/prod/esen/model.esen.intgemm.alphas.bin
vocabs:
  - firefox-translations-models/models/prod/esen/vocab.esen.spm
  - firefox-translations-models/models/prod/esen/vocab.esen.spm
shortlist:
    - firefox-translations-models/models/prod/esen/lex.50.50.esen.s2t.bin
    - false
beam-size: 1
normalize: 1.0
word-penalty: 0
max-length-break: 128
mini-batch-words: 1024
workspace: 128
max-length-factor: 2.0
skip-cost: true
cpu-threads: 0
quiet: false
quiet-translation: false
gemm-precision: int8shiftAlphaAll
alignment: soft
```

where `esen` is the language pair for the translation, in this case es&rarr;en (Spanish to English).


The models/vocabs/shortlist files _should_ be sourced from the `firefox-translations-models` repository, with `git-lfs`. There's some docs which still point to Google
cloud storage for downloads, but those are stale.

With the models on hand, I could pipe some data through `bergamot-translator`:

```bash
echo "Hola mundo" | ./bergamot-translator
Hello world
```

At this point, I thought that using the bergamot shared library would be trivial and I'd be done in _no time_.

## Android app scaffolding
I knew I would _easily_ build `libbergamot.so` for Android, so I downloaded Android studio, built a "Hello world" app and, through a bunch of clicking,
I added a "Native Library" module, which gave me _way too many files_, but here are the important ones:

`bergamot.cpp`, an adaptor from "Java calling convention" to "CPP calling convention" 
```cpp

extern "C" JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL
Java_com_example_bergamot_NativeLib_stringFromJNI(
        JNIEnv* env,
        jobject /* this */) {
    return env->NewStringUTF("Hello from CPP");
}
```

`NativeLib.kt`, a Kotlin class wrapping the CPP adapter (obviously)

```kotlin
package com.example.bergamot

class NativeLib {
    external fun stringFromJNI(cfg: String, data: String): String
    companion object {
        // Used to load the 'bergamot' library on application startup.
        init {
            System.loadLibrary("bergamot-sys")
        }
    }
}
```

`CMakeLists.txt`, the build file for the cpp library:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22.1)
project("bergamot-sys")
add_library(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} SHARED
        bergamot.cpp)

target_link_libraries(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}
        android
        log
)
```

So, let's go build this `libbergamot`

## The descent into CMake madness

I thought that I only needed to do this

```diff
 add_library(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} SHARED
         bergamot.cpp)

+add_subdirectory("bergamot-translator/")

 target_link_libraries(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}
         # List libraries link to the target library
+        bergamot-translator
         android
         log
 )
```

and go on with my life.

Boy, was I wrong.

- Broken when trying to build `aarch64`, okay just comment out

```diff
     ndk {
+        abiFilters += listOf("x86_64") // armeabi-v7a arm64-v8a
     }
```

- no unix paths
- no pcre2
- no openblas

## A despairing detour into WASM


## Back out of WASM


- Add pcre2 flag local
- pathie fix `minSdk = 28 // iconv requirements from pathie-cpp`
- fuckit clone openblas in android SDK sysroot
- fuckit clone superlu in android SDK sysroot
- fuckit patch superlu

it... built???

```bash
file ..
x86
nm | grep func
found
```

## Loading the lib

`Fatal signal 4 (SIGILL), code 2 (ILL_ILLOPN)` on load

okay, add debugger in the Kotlin `NativeLib.kt` file, just `Debug.waitForDebugger()`

recompule in debug mode, it dies in some `set` stdlib operation?? wtf, it's some global about deprecated options, don't care, comment it out and rebuild

the shared lib loaded?????

Let's call the translate function

insta SIGILL again

with debugger see that it dies in similar stdlib operation, but this time i'm smart and run `disas` in `lldb`, get a dump of the running assembly:

```asm
...
...
vmovss ...
```

search for [vmovss](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/movss), it's an AVX instruction to move an `f32` around. wait. WAIT.

```bash
$ adb shell cat /proc/cpuinfo
emu64xa:/ $ 
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 6
model           : 6
model name      : Android virtual processor
cpuid level     : 16
flags           : fpu de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush mmx fxsr sse ss
e2 ht syscall nx lm nopl cpuid tsc_known_freq pni ssse3 cx16 sse4_1 sse4_2 x2apic popcnt tsc_deadline_timer h
ypervisor lahf_lm cmp_legacy abm 3dnowprefetch vmmcall 
```

do you see it?? yeah, neither did I! `avx` is **not** part of the supported flags for the emulator's processor; of course `vmovss` is going to `SIGILL`.

I poked _a bunch_ and couldn't get AVX to stop being part of the build, but that's a problem for later Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯


## Enabling AVX on the emulator

There was no option in Android Studio to enable `avx` on the emulator&mdash;I understand why, they [specifically](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis#86-64) tell you to use runtime probing & fallbacks for it.

But.. I'm smarter than a shitty Eclipse fork, so I started the emulator from Android studio and ran 

```bash
$ ps aux | grep qemu

.../emulator/qemu/linux-x86_64/qemu-system-x86_64 -netdelay none -netspeed full -avd Medium_Phone_API_35 -qt-hide-window -grpc-use-token -idle-grpc-timeout 300 -no-snapshot-load
```

then I tried to run the emulator directly
```bash
./emulator/qemu/linux-x86_64/qemu-system-x86_64 ....

error while loading shared libraries: libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

but it depends on shared libraries that are not part of the system, typical.

I found the lib in `ANDROID_SDK/emulator/lib64`, so added I added the path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and hit the same error with `libQt6WebChannelAndroidEmu.so.6`, repeating the process, adding `ANDROID_SDK/emulator/lib64/qt/lib` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, the emulator starts up!

Now, we just need to convince this `qemu` wrapper to enable AVX on the guest. Reading the emulator's `--help`, I found out that there's a flag `-qemu ..` which passes all further arguments directly to qemu, so le'ts spawn an emulator with AVX support

```bash
cd $ANDROID_SDK/emulator
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib64:$PWD/lib64/qt/lib
./qemu/linux-x86_64/qemu-system-x86_64 ... -no-snapshot-load -qemu -cpu "max"
```
once it starts up
```bash
$ adb shell grep -q /proc/cpuinfo && echo success
success
```

<div class="aside">
The `-no-snapshot-load` flag was important -- otherwise the `AVX` instructions would work _sometimes_. It seems like `/proc/cpuinfo` is not updated if the emulator boots a "snapshot" (fair, maybe it's a RAM dump)... but even then, why would the instructions `SIGILL` if the CPU supports them? Maybe there's something specific the kernel has to do at boot time to enable AVX?
</div>


At this point the app starts without crashing, so we just need to get it to do something.

## Struggling to do basic tasks on Android

Or, "How I struggled _a bunch_ to perform what should be absolutely trivial tasks."

Now that the app was launching, I needed to pass it some yaml (ðŸ¤¢) with paths to the models, and obviously, have the models stored there.

How do you even get a file to the emulator?? `adb push` didn't have access to the app's paths, and the app didn't have access to the "general storage" (/storage/emulated/0/...)

In the end, it was easier to implement some wacky code to download the files straight from Google (.\_.) if they are not present on disk

```kotlin
val base = "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/mozilla/firefox-translations-models/refs/heads/main/models/prod/"
val lang = "esen"
val model = "model.esen.intgemm.alphas.bin"
val vocab = "vocab.esen.spm"
val lex = "lex.50.50.esen.s2t.bin"
val files = arrayOf(model, vocab, lex)
val dataPath = baseContext.getExternalFilesDir("bin")!!

files.forEach { f ->
    val file = File(dataPath.absolutePath + "/" + f)
    if (!file.exists()) {
        val dm = this.getSystemService(Context.DOWNLOAD_SERVICE) as DownloadManager
        val request = DownloadManager.Request(Uri.parse("${base}/${lang}/${f}"))
        request.setNotificationVisibility(DownloadManager.Request.VISIBILITY_VISIBLE_NOTIFY_COMPLETED)
        request.setTitle("Downloading ${f}")
        val out = Uri.fromFile(file)
        request.setDestinationUri(out)
        val downloadReference = dm.enqueue(request) ?: 0
    }
}
```

Now I can also generate the YAML and call the function

```kotlin
val cfg = """
models:
  - ${dataPath}/${model}
vocabs:
  - ${dataPath}/${vocab}
  - ${dataPath}/${vocab}
shortlist:
    - ${dataPath}/${lex}
    - false
...
"""
val input = "Hola mundo"
val nl = NativeLib()
val output: String
val elapsed = measureTimeMillis {
    output = nl.stringFromJNI(cfg, input)
}
```


this worked!

run 500ms, if run twice second one is 250ms.. some cache?

Some AI generated code later, I have a basic app that works:

one feature that is very nice in google trnslate is auto-detecting source language, so only one choice is needed

firefox and chrome seem to use [compact language detector](https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2/tree/master)
per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/detectLanguage)
