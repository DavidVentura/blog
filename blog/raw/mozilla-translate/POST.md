Some time ago, Firefox [introduced](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/118.0/releasenotes/) in-browser, on-device translation for webpages. I know that Chrome users have had this forever,
but I'm not comfortable sending all my browsing data to Google.

This new feature was super useful for me, and I started wondering if I could also use it outside of the browser.


I did some research and found out that Mozilla publishes the [firefox-translation-models on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-translations-models/tree/main), and that
there's a piece of software called [bergamot-translator](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator) which can run these models, by wrapping [marian-nmt](https://marian-nmt.github.io).


With some basic idea of the software landscape, I tried it out

## Running bergamot-translator on Linux

`bergamot-translator` is very straight-forward to build

```bash
$ git clone
$ mkdir build
$ sudo apt install libpcre2-dev libopenblas-dev
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
```

but how to _run_ this? I ended up reading a bunch of code for CI/tests/.. on the repo and figured out that I needed a YAML file _exactly_ like this one:

```yaml
bergamot-mode: native
models:
  - firefox-translations-models/models/prod/esen/model.esen.intgemm.alphas.bin
vocabs:
  - firefox-translations-models/models/prod/esen/vocab.esen.spm
  - firefox-translations-models/models/prod/esen/vocab.esen.spm
shortlist:
    - firefox-translations-models/models/prod/esen/lex.50.50.esen.s2t.bin
    - false
beam-size: 1
normalize: 1.0
word-penalty: 0
max-length-break: 128
mini-batch-words: 1024
workspace: 128
max-length-factor: 2.0
skip-cost: true
cpu-threads: 0
quiet: false
quiet-translation: false
gemm-precision: int8shiftAlphaAll
alignment: soft
```

where `esen` is the language pair for the translation, in this case es&rarr;en (Spanish to English).


The models/vocabs/shortlist files _should_ be sourced from the `firefox-translations-models` repository, with `git-lfs`. There's some docs which still point to Google
cloud storage for downloads, but those are stale.

With the models on hand, I could pipe some data through `bergamot-translator`:

```bash
echo "Hola mundo" | ./bergamot-translator
Hello world
```

At this point, I thought that using the bergamot shared library would be trivial and I'd be done in _no time_.

## Android app scaffolding

I assumed that building a shared library (`libbergamot.so`) for Android would be trivial; just set some build target variable and be done with it.

It was not entirely accurate, first, I needed to download Android Studio (a shitty Java-based IDE), built a "Hello world" app and, through a bunch of clicking,
I added a "Native Library" module, which created _way too many files_.

Only three of those files are actually important to me:

`bergamot.cpp`, an adaptor from "Java calling convention" to "CPP calling convention" 
```cpp

extern "C" JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL
Java_com_example_bergamot_NativeLib_stringFromJNI(
        JNIEnv* env,
        jobject /* this */) {
    return env->NewStringUTF("Hello from CPP");
}
```

`NativeLib.kt`, a Kotlin class wrapping the CPP adapter (obviously more wrappers is more good)

```kotlin
package com.example.bergamot

class NativeLib {
    external fun stringFromJNI(cfg: String, data: String): String
    companion object {
        // Used to load the 'bergamot' library on application startup.
        init {
            System.loadLibrary("bergamot-sys")
        }
    }
}
```

`CMakeLists.txt`, the build file for the cpp library:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22.1)
project("bergamot-sys")
add_library(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} SHARED
        bergamot.cpp)

target_link_libraries(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}
        android
        log
)
```

So, let's go build this `libbergamot`

## The descent into CMake madness

<div class="warning">
I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing when it comes to C++, CMake or Android, so likely my struggles are user error.
</div>



I thought that I only needed to do add the source code to my CMake project & link the resulting library, like this:

```diff
 add_library(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} SHARED
         bergamot.cpp)

+add_subdirectory("bergamot-translator/")

 target_link_libraries(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}
         # List libraries link to the target library
+        bergamot-translator
         android
         log
 )
```

Boy, was I wrong.

As soon as I hit the little ðŸ”¨ icon to start the build, my computer fans went into overdrive, and all I got out of it was failures on all architectures:

<center>
![](assets/build_failed_all_arch.png)
</center>

Let's try to fix one thing at a time, and build only for `x86_64` for now

On `build.gradle.kts`, under `android.defaultConfig`, we can add the architecture filter
```diff
+    ndk {
+        abiFilters += listOf("x86_64")
+    }
```

Every time there's a change in this file, I get to press "Sync Now" on Android studio, what a great piece of software.

If we try again, we get 42KiB worth of error logs over 438 lines, which seems to be how the average Java/C++ developer goes through their life Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

### PCRE2 dependency
Distilling the errors, there are only 3 lines which seem to have any relevance at all:

```text
C/C++: CMake Warning at bergamot-translator/3rd_party/marian-dev/CMakeLists.txt:577 (message):
C/C++:   COMPILE_CUDA=off : Building only CPU version
C/C++: CMake Warning at bergamot-translator/3rd_party/marian-dev/CMakeLists.txt:614 (message):
C/C++:   Cannot find TCMalloc library.  Continuing.
C/C++: CMake Error at bergamot-translator/3rd_party/ssplit-cpp/CMakeLists.txt:46 (message):
C/C++:   Cannot find pcre2 libraries.  Terminating.
```

Warnings are for people with time and working software, let's focus on making `pcre2` work:

I tried to add some CMake commands I found online, but I couldn't get `ssplit-cpp` to pick `pcre2` up after at least an hour of random fiddling;
In my struggles, I opened `bergamot-translator/3rd_party/ssplit-cpp/CMakeLists.txt` and found this very promising line:

```cmake
option(SSPLIT_USE_INTERNAL_PCRE2 "Use internal PCRE2 instead of system's." OFF)
```

so instead of adding `pcre2` as a submodule & building it manually, I turned the option on:

```cmake
set(SSPLIT_USE_INTERNAL_PCRE2 ON)
```

but apparently this is not enough, as it was not being picked up by the build.

The correct way is to do

```cmake
set(SSPLIT_USE_INTERNAL_PCRE2 ON CACHE BOOL)
```

which will make the variable not be overwritten by options declared further down the compile chain.


with this change, the build progressed quite a bit further (and melted my PC again) and got to some non-CMake errors, I consider this a resounding victory.

### Missing intrinsics

Within the `faiss` library, there are multiple errors about undefined intrinsics, for example:

```text
 error: unknown type name '__m128'
  148 | static inline __m128 masked_read(int d, const float *x)
      |               ^
 error: use of undeclared identifier '_mm_load_ps'
  165 |   return _mm_load_ps(buf);
      |          ^
```

This is fairly simple to solve, by adding a few gated includes on `VectorTransform.h`

```c
#if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(_M_X64)
#include <xmmintrin.h>
#include <emmintrin.h>
#include <pmmintrin.h>
#endif
```

### iconv issues

Similar to the previous step, there's uses of undeclared functions:

```text
 error: use of undeclared identifier 'iconv_open'
  121 |   iconv_t converter    = iconv_open(to_encoding, from_encoding);
      |                          ^
 error: use of undeclared identifier 'iconv'
  152 |     iconv(converter, &inbuf, &inbytes_left, &outbuf, &outbytes_left); // sets outbytes_left to 0 or very low values if not enough space (E2BIG)
      |     ^
...
```

A quick check on the [bionic source code](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/libc/bionic/iconv.cpp#341) shows that `iconv_open` is absolutely defined, what's going on?

Without thinking, I spent some time patching this code, as I thought that these code paths are not used, but that just led to an ever-increasing scope creep of how much I needed to patch.

In the end, I found out that `iconv_` functions are defined on Android SDK version 28 or later, so we only need to update the `build.gradle.kts` file:

```diff
 defaultConfig {
-     minSdk = 24
+     minSdk = 28
```

Bumping the `minSdk` will make the app supported on 92% of devices, instead of 97% per [apilevels](https://apilevels.com/), but I don't want to spend more time figuring this out.

with this change, the library built?? I'm shocked it was only these errors

## Runtime hell

The library built, the app starts and... shuts down, with this stacktrace

```text

      #32 pc 0000000000001870  base.apk (com.example.myapplication.MainActivity.onCreate+0)
```

aren't C++ identifiers a thing of beauty?

Okay, we can power through this, let's add debugger in the `NativeLib.kt` file, which is just a single line: `Debug.waitForDebugger()`

We get dropped to `LLDB`, and the backtrace (from running `bt`) matches the previous log.

We can inspect a little bit, with the annotated source code, and it seems that we are inside a global constructor, in `cli_wrapper.cpp` (a file from the `marian-dev` project):

```cpp
const std::unordered_set<std::string> DEPRECATED_OPTIONS = {
  "version",
  "special-vocab",
// @TODO: uncomment once we actually deprecate them.
//  "after-batches",
//  "after-epochs"
};
```
this seems... innocuous; why would the app die here?

Trying to look at the actual CPU instructions is not useful -- we'd landed in a constructor table which doesn't tell much
```text
...
    0x710921c96877 <+119>: callq  0x710921c96650            ; ::__cxx_global_var_init.68() at cli_wrapper.cpp
    0x710921c9687c <+124>: callq  0x710921c96670            ; ::__cxx_global_var_init.69() at cli_wrapper.cpp
->  0x710921c96881 <+129>: popq   %rbp
    0x710921c96882 <+130>: retq
```

Let's add debug information by adding this to `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
 set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)
```

now when running `disas` we get a better view of the issue:

```asm
    0x710923dc402c <+12>: movq   -0x8(%rbp), %rax
    0x710923dc4030 <+16>: movq   -0x10(%rbp), %rcx
->  0x710923dc4034 <+20>: vmovss (%rcx), %xmm0             ; xmm0 = mem[0],zero,zero,zero 
    0x710923dc4038 <+24>: vmovss %xmm0, (%rax)
    0x710923dc403c <+28>: popq   %rbp
    0x710923dc403d <+29>: retq
```
searching online for [vmovss](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/movss), it's an AVX instruction to move an `f32` around. wait. WAIT.

```bash
$ adb shell cat /proc/cpuinfo
emu64xa:/ $ 
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 6
model           : 6

cpuid level     : 16

ypervisor lahf_lm cmp_legacy abm 3dnowprefetch vmmcall 
```

do you see it?? yeah, neither do I! `avx` is **not** part of the supported flags for the emulator's processor; of course `vmovss` is an illegal instruction!

I spent _hours_ poking these projects to try and get them to build without emitting AVX instructions and couldn't manage. I guess that's a problem for later Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯


### Enabling AVX on the emulator

There was no option in Android Studio to enable `avx` on the emulator&mdash;I understand why, they [specifically](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis#86-64) tell you to use runtime probing & fallbacks for it.

But.. I'm smarter than a shitty Java IDE, so I started the emulator from Android studio and ran 

```bash
$ ps aux | grep qemu

.../emulator/qemu/linux-x86_64/qemu-system-x86_64 -netdelay none -netspeed full -avd Medium_Phone_API_35 -qt-hide-window -grpc-use-token -idle-grpc-timeout 300 -no-snapshot-load
```

with this command, I tried to run the emulator directly
```bash
./emulator/qemu/linux-x86_64/qemu-system-x86_64 ....

error while loading shared libraries: libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

but it depends on shared libraries that are not part of the system, typical.

I found the lib in `ANDROID_SDK/emulator/lib64`, so added I added the path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and hit the same error with `libQt6WebChannelAndroidEmu.so.6`, repeating the process, adding `ANDROID_SDK/emulator/lib64/qt/lib` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, the emulator starts up!

Now, we just need to convince this `qemu` wrapper to enable AVX on the guest. Reading the emulator's `--help`, I found out that there's a flag `-qemu ..` which passes all further arguments directly to qemu, so le'ts spawn an emulator with AVX support

```bash
cd $ANDROID_SDK/emulator
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib64:$PWD/lib64/qt/lib
./qemu/linux-x86_64/qemu-system-x86_64 ... -no-snapshot-load -qemu -cpu "max"
```
once it starts up
```bash
$ adb shell grep -q /proc/cpuinfo && echo success
success
```

<div class="aside">
The <code>-no-snapshot-load</code> flag was important -- otherwise the <code>AVX</code> instructions would work _sometimes_. It seems like <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> is not updated if the emulator boots a "snapshot" (fair, maybe it's a RAM dump)... but even then, why would the instructions <code>SIGILL</code> if the CPU supports them? Maybe there's something specific the kernel has to do at boot time to enable AVX?
</div>


We start the emulator and are greeted by a most beautiful sight:
<center>
![](assets/running.png)
</center>

Now we just need to get the app to do something.

## Struggling to do basic tasks on Android

Or, "How I struggled _a bunch_ to perform what should be absolutely trivial tasks."

Now that the app was launching, I copied the [example bergamot-translator application](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator/blob/main/app/bergamot.cpp) to this project.

The example application needs some yaml (ðŸ¤¢) with paths to the models, and obviously, the app will need to be able to read the models from disk.

How do you even get a file to the emulator?? `adb push` didn't have access to the app's paths, and the app didn't have access to the "general storage" (/storage/emulated/0/...)

In the end, it was easier to implement some wacky code to download the files straight from the Github repo (.\_.) if they are not present on disk

```kotlin
val base = "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/mozilla/firefox-translations-models/main/models/prod"
val lang = "esen"
val model = "model.esen.intgemm.alphas.bin"
val vocab = "vocab.esen.spm"
val lex = "lex.50.50.esen.s2t.bin"
val files = arrayOf(model, vocab, lex)
val dataPath = baseContext.getExternalFilesDir("bin")!!

lifecycleScope.launch {
    files.forEach { f ->
        val file = File(dataPath.absolutePath + "/" + f)
        if (!file.exists()) {
            val url = "${base}/${lang}/${f}.gz"
            val success = downloadAndDecompress(url, file)
        }
    }
}
```

Now I can also generate the YAML and call the function

```kotlin
val cfg = """
models:
  - ${dataPath}/${model}
vocabs:
  - ${dataPath}/${vocab}
  - ${dataPath}/${vocab}
shortlist:
    - ${dataPath}/${lex}
    - false
...
"""
val input = "Hola mundo"
val nl = NativeLib()
val output: String
val elapsed = measureTimeMillis {
    output = nl.stringFromJNI(cfg, input)
}
```


aaaand the translation immediately aborts the program:

```text
ABORT("Marian must be compiled with a BLAS library");
```

Gaaaaaaaaah

## CMake is the mind-killer

Reading [marian-dev's CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt),
there are a few options for {^BLAS|Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms} libraries, the default is `MKL`, Intel's optimized library
for x86-64, which probably has the best performance, but I'd rather only have to deal with one library for both x86-64 and aarch64.

How to figure out why this library isn't being linked/found though?? well, the code that `ABORT`ed before looks like this:

```cpp
#if BLAS_FOUND
    // ...
#elif USE_ONNX_SGEMM
    // ...
#elif USE_RUY_SGEMM
    // ...
#else
    ABORT("Marian must be compiled with a BLAS library");
#endif
```

and `BLAS_FOUND` is conditionally defined in `marian-dev`'s CMake file
```cmake
if(MKL_FOUND)
  include_directories(${MKL_INCLUDE_DIR})
  set(EXT_LIBS ${EXT_LIBS} ${MKL_LIBRARIES})
  set(BLAS_FOUND TRUE)
  add_definitions(-DBLAS_FOUND=1 -DMKL_FOUND=1)
else(MKL_FOUND)
  set(BLAS_VENDOR "OpenBLAS")
  find_package(BLAS)
  if(BLAS_FOUND)
    include(FindCBLAS)
    if(CBLAS_FOUND)
      include_directories(${BLAS_INCLUDE_DIR} ${CBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR})
      set(EXT_LIBS ${EXT_LIBS} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES} ${CBLAS_LIBRARIES})
      add_definitions(-DBLAS_FOUND=1)
    endif(CBLAS_FOUND)
  endif(BLAS_FOUND)
endif(MKL_FOUND)
```

We don't want to use `MKL`, so we need to make `find_package(BLAS)` succeed and set `BLAS_FOUND`.

I don't know how to debug CMake, so I added a line to force-fail the build, instead of allowing the build to succeed and failing on runtime
```diff
+  else(BLAS_FOUND)
+    message(FATAL_ERROR "BLAS not found, bailing")
   endif(BLAS_FOUND)
```

which worked wonderfully, giving me a way to try things without waiting for a full build.

Now, I could update the CMakeLists.txt file to include OpenBLAS
```cmake
add_subdirectory(third_party/OpenBLAS)
set(BLAS_LIBRARIES "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/third_party/OpenBLAS/lib/libopenblas.a" CACHE PATH "BLAS Libraries" FORCE)
```

and the build succeeded!

However, on runtime, I still got

```c
ABORT("Marian must be compiled with a BLAS library");
```

turns out that, if you look at the previous requirement, it also needs to run `FindCBLAS` successfully; for this I only needed

```cmake
set(CBLAS_LIBRARIES ${BLAS_LIBRARIES} CACHE PATH "CBLAS Libraries" FORCE)
set(CBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/third_party/OpenBLAS" CACHE PATH "CBLAS Include Directory" FORCE)
```

but now the build started failing.


### Patching compiler complaints away


My patience started to run out, and I got into a state of "just patch everything, make it work"

<div class="aside">
At this point I took a somewhat long detour into trying to build the library as a WASM blob,
which is significantly easier; but when trying to embed that WASM blob in the Android side,
I noticed how painful that is.

Also, the WASM build was 2-4x slower than the native build
</div>

First, OpenBLAS' build thinks we are cross compiling (and maybe we are? it's x86-64 to x86-64 but with different ABI/sysroot/..),
so we need to define a `TARGET` architecture:

```cmake
```cmake
if(ANDROID_ABI STREQUAL "x86_64")
    # thinks we are CC, so must set a TARGET
    set(TARGET "ZEN" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
endif()
```

Immediately after that, I got an error I'd never seen before

```text
 error: inline assembly requires more registers than available
  505 |     for(;n_count>23;n_count-=24) COMPUTE(24)
      |                                  ^
```

There's some info [in this github issue](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/issues/2634), but it did not work for me.

What did work was force-disabling AVX, which avoids this entire path (the file being compiled was for skylake, which I don't have).
```cmake
    set(NO_AVX ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    set(NO_AVX2 ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    set(NO_AVX512 ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
```

Let's build and see what pops up next:

```text
 error: call to undeclared function 'num_cpu_avail'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  202 |   int ncpu = num_cpu_avail(3);
      |              ^
```

whatever, this is only called in two places, and it can _easily_ be replaced with `4` , which seems like a perfectly valid number of CPUs.

Next, a missing file which cannot be included:

```text
common.h:62:10: fatal error: 'config.h' file not found
   62 | #include "config.h"
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~
```

let's comment it out and see what breaks



in OpenBLAS I started hitting issues with a macro `YIELDING` not being defined but it should be defined, per 
```c
#if defined(ARCH_X86_64)
#ifndef YIELDING
#define YIELDING        __asm__ __volatile__ ("nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;\n");
#endif
#endif
```

I'm assuming `ARCH_X86_64` must be defined in `config.h`, so I reported the [issue](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/issues/5105), and generated the
`config.h` with `#define ARCH_X86_64`, because adding this to CMakeLists.txt did not work

```cmake
set(ARCH_X86_64 ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE) # required for defining YIELDING
```

The build progresses a bit further, but fails again
```
intgemm.cc:58:20: error: use of undeclared identifier '__get_cpuid_max'
   58 |   unsigned int m = __get_cpuid_max(0, 0);
      |                    ^
```

`__get_cpuid_max` seems to not be defined in Android's `cpuid.h`, but as [the ABI](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis#86-64) guarantees up to SSE4.1, we can just patch it

```diff
-#if defined(WASM)
+#if defined(WASM) || defined(__ANDROID__)
   return CPUType::SSSE3;
```

and... it built??

taking 2 seconds tu translate 2 words though

let's build in release mode?

```
 error: use of undeclared identifier 'GEMM_MULTITHREAD_THRESHOLD'
   91 |   if ( MN < 115200L * GEMM_MULTITHREAD_THRESHOLD )
      |                       ^
```

needed to add `#define ZEN` in `config.h`

tests started failing, needed to comment them out

`marian-dev/src/3rd_party/sentencepiece/third_party/absl/flags/flag.cc` has undefined `PACKAGE_STRING` and `VERSION`, but `flag.cc` is not used anywhere! why is it being built? well, that's for somebody else to answer
now I'll just `#define` these two

 error: call to undeclared function 'pthread_cancel';
marian-dev hardcodes threads, but can't link pthread in android

  else(COMPILE_WASM)                   
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS                 "-std=c++11 -pthread ${CMAKE_GCC_FLAGS} -fPIC ${DISABLE_GLOBALLY} -march=${BUILD_ARCH} ${INTRINSICS} ${BUILD_WIDTH}")

- something about superlu makes it faster?
- or is superlu for the auto lang detect??

Some AI generated code later, I have a basic app that works:

one feature that is very nice in google trnslate is auto-detecting source language, so only one choice is needed

firefox and chrome seem to use [compact language detector](https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2/tree/master)
per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/detectLanguage)
